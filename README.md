# Sex Education and Health

How well can sexual education laws and access to family planning predict a country's health indicators, specifically relating to women and girls?

## Summary
This project focuses on sexual education around the world, and its relation to health outcomes for women and girls. I use data from the sustainable development goals, which calculate scores for each country based on the extent to which sexual education is available. For this analysis, I was interested in determining how well a countryâ€™s sexual education profile could predict health outcomes for women and girls, and found that the relationship, while positive, was not very strong. Other indicators, such as inequality and school enrollment for girls, seem to be better predictors of the outcomes I observed.

## Motivation
The idea for this project stems from my interest in the social determinants of health. Beyond medical factors, there are so many social, cultural, and economic factors that impact health. My project serves to show that a multitude of factors are at play, and that no single factor can improve health on its own. Each of the predictors I included in my models, in their own way, have an impact on health. Inequality and education are obvious ones, but less related factors (e.g. level of democracy) as well as more targeted factors (e.g. sexual education laws) can play a significant role in improving health outcomes. Solving major health challenges will require adressing all of these public policy areas.

## Data
My data comes from UN Stats, the World Development Indicators, the Center for Systemic Peace, the UN Population Division, the UN Development Programme, the World Health Organization, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The dates range from 2017 to 2020, or the most recent year. I carefully selected datasets that I considered useful for my project, and spent a lot of time preparing and merging each dataset to have a single, coherent dataset. This process included making sure the country names were the same in each dataset (which was rarely the case), so that I could merge them seamlessly. The original datasets can be found in the raw_data folder of my GitHub repository. In the repo, you can also find my Shiny app and data wrangling code.
