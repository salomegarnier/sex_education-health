# 1. Shiny Apps have two basic parts to them
# 
#   - The user interface (UI) defines how the app should look.
#
#     -- For example, the text on the page, the placement of the elements, etc.
#
#   - The server defines how the app should behave.
#
#     -- This is how live elements are updated - like selecting a state from a list.
#
#   - Those two pieces are combined by running shinyApp(ui, server) to create the app.
# 
#      -- You can also click the green "Run App" button on the top right or 
#         run runApp() in the console

  navbarPage("SDGs: Sex Education in the World",

             # 
             #   -- There is a "main panel," a "sidebar," a "title," etc.

                        #   -- In general, these are defined by functions that you give arguments to (e.g. min and max values).
                        # 
                        # - These include:
                        #   
                        #   -- selectInput() to choose from multiple options.
                        # 
                        #   -- sliderInput() lets you choose a value from a slider of values you define.
                        #    
                        #   -- radioButtons() let you choose a button from a number of options
                        #    
                        #   -- textInput() lets you enter whatever text you want.
                        #
                        #   -- Lots of other options, like entering a date. Look at the resources for other choices!
                        #
                        # - You then assign these inputs to a value and use those values in other places, like in plots!
                        #
                        # - All of these functions have their own arguments. For example:
                        
                        # selectInput(inputId = "selected_state",                  # a name for the value you choose here
